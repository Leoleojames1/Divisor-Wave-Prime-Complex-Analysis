# Getting Started
Watch The video explanation for the paper, a new video for the software will be coming soon, but dont let this stop you from trying to run it.

## What is Divisor Wave Prime Complex Analysis?
These waveforms breakdown the structure of prime numbers and represent them in a new light, the Divisor Wave Prime Complex Analysis plotting software is an infinite domain which I have defined for researching these special functions. 
Ultimately this software contains infinitely many functions which I have not gotten the opportunity to explore, and because of this I invite you to join me in transversing the complex plane for discrete product series, and there relationship to primes, chaos, order, and mathematics. 
## Downloading the PDF File:
For full comprehension of the software please read PDF version of the research paper which is located in the repository under the folder PDF_Files Please either pulldown/download the entire repository for Divisor Wave Prime Complex Analysis or Navigate to the PDF file in the repository to read the paper, pdf file named: Divisor_Waves_and_their_Connection_to_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.pdf


I have been working hard on these proofs for the past 4 years and now with the advent of ChatGPT which can be tasked with automating the convertion of data types, leveraging this I have had an explosive amount of research opportunities given the swiftness of implementation.
The Divisor Wave Prime Complex Analysis Plotting software is free and open source, and encourages development by users. Given the environment users can create and research new formulas in the complex space of product series allowing anyone to find novel functions in an uncharted territory. 

# Divisor-Wave-Prime-Complex-Analysis
A program for plotting complex functions. This tool provides the plotting functions for 2D and 3D graphics for infinite series such as the Riemann zeta function, 
the infinite product of the product representation for sin(pi*z/n) as well as any other function that can be formulated in the complex plane. The Infinite product plotted throughout the paper known as b(z) acts as an indicator for prime and composite numbers. ultimately we can describe a complex product waveform which contains the attributes of the factorization for any composite number utilizing complex variable factorization.

Ultimately knowledge should be free however it takes a lot of time and work to develop the mathematics, proofs and software required, I would really appreciate 
it, if you feel inclined to donate to help me keep developing this software and writing this paper. You can find the donation link in the file called bitcoin_donation_wallet.txt

Also if you want read my original paper I wrote in 2020 which initially started my journey on the Riemann Hypothesis here:
