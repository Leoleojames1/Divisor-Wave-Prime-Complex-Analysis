# Getting Started
If you have not already, please download the PDF called:
Divisor_Waves_and_their_Connection_to_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.pdf

I have been working hard on these proofs for the past 3.5 years and now with the advent of ChatGPT, I have had an explosive amount of research.
The Special functions software is free and open source. I am also providing my chatgpt prompts so that others can learn from my prompt engineering examples.

If you want to learn more about the Riemann Hypothesis and the Millenium prize problems you can find them at the following sources:

Ultimately I want to use this data to train a language model such as dalai llama, or GPT4 using the methods and information provided in this repository such that
we can create an AI specialized in mathematical analysis for all fields of mathematics. Currently I have proposed the idea to the singularity group on @AtheneLive
you can see the most recent twitch vod clip here where Lex fridman, Carli g, and Athene give their responses:

# Special-Functions
A program for plotting complex functions. This tool provides the plotting functions for 2D and 3D graphics for infinite series such as the Riemann zeta function, 
the infinite product of the product representation for sin(pi*z/n) as well as any other function that can be formulated in the complex plane.

# About Me
My name is Leo Borcherding, I am a Software Developer with experience working on programs for encryption of firmware devices. I have a background in electrical
engineering and my passion is mathematics as well as art. I am developing this software so that we can further our understanding of mathematics, physics, 
and the universe. Please contact me at borchborchmail@gmail.com if you have questions or are able to do something interesting with my software or math.
Ultimately knowledge should be free however it takes a lot of time and work to develop the mathematics, proofs and software required, I would really appreciate 
it, if you feel inclined to donate to help me keep developing this software and writing this paper. You can find the donation link in the file called bitcoin_donation_wallet.txt
