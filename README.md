# Getting Started
If you have not already, please download the PDF called:
Divisor_Waves_and_their_Connection_to_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.pdf

I have been working hard on these proofs for the past 4 years and now with the advent of ChatGPT which can be tasked with automating the convertion of data types, leveraging this I have had an explosive amount of research opportunities given the swiftness of implementation.
The Special functions software is free and open source.

# Special-Functions
A program for plotting complex functions. This tool provides the plotting functions for 2D and 3D graphics for infinite series such as the Riemann zeta function, 
the infinite product of the product representation for sin(pi*z/n) as well as any other function that can be formulated in the complex plane. The Infinite product plotted throughout the paper known as b(z) acts as an indicator for prime and composite numbers. ultimately we can describe a complex product waveform which contains the attributes of the factorization for any composite number utilizing multivariable factorization.

# About Me
My name is Leo Borcherding, I am a Software Developer with experience working on programs for encryption of firmware devices. I have a background in electrical
engineering and my passion is mathematics as well as art. I am developing this software so that we can further our understanding of mathematics, physics, 
and the universe. Please contact me at borchborchmail@gmail.com if you have questions or are able to do something interesting with my software or math. You can also leave feedback on the software in this submission form:

Ultimately knowledge should be free however it takes a lot of time and work to develop the mathematics, proofs and software required, I would really appreciate 
it, if you feel inclined to donate to help me keep developing this software and writing this paper. You can find the donation link in the file called bitcoin_donation_wallet.txt

Also if you want read my original paper I wrote in 2020 which initially started my journey on the Riemann Hypothesis here:
