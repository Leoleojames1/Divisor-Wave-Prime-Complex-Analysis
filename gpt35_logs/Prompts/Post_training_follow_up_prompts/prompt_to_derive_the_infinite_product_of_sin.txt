Using latex code, please derive the identity and show how the functions relate to each other:

Take the function:
a(x) = ∏_(n=2)^x (sin(π*x/n)) 

And Derive the Function:
b(x) = ∏_(n=2)^x (π*x) ∏_(n=2)^x (1-(x^2)/(k^2)(n^2))

using the identity produced by Euler for the infinite product representation of sin:

sin(π*x/n) = ∏_(n=2)^x (1-(x^2)/(k^2)(n^2))

by substituting this infinite product

∏_(n=2)^x (1-(x^2)/(k^2)(n^2))

for the trig function

sin(pi*x/n)

in the function:

a(x) = ∏_(n=2)^x (sin(π*x/n))
